    "## 01 - Introduction to Python, Jupyterlab, and the ENKI Server\n",
    "Welcome to the VESIcal workshop. Before we get started on VESIcal calculations, we will introduce the Jupyterlab interface, and how to get started with python\n",
    "\n",
    "Every Jupyter notebook is made up of cells. Each cell might contain typset text (like the one you are reading now) or code (could be python, or other programming languages) with its output immediately below. The Jupyter notebook you are reading now is most likely running on an instance of the ENKI server. The ENKI server provides powerful tools for petrological thermodynamic calculations, and is the software upon which VESIcal is written. The VESIcal workshop server will only be available for the duration of the workshop. If you want to continue using VESIcal, you can get access to the a public instance of the ENKI server [here](server.enki-portal.org), or read the VESIcal documentation [here](https://vesical.readthedocs.io/en/latest/about.html#many-ways-to-use-vesical) for other ways of using VESIcal. It is also possible to install the ENKI software on your own computer- see [here](https://gitlab.com/ENKI-portal/ThermoEngine) for more info.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will give you a very brief introduction to python. However, you don't actually need to understand any of this to use VESIcal. There are many example notebooks for you to use with VESIcal, including the ones you will use today, and you just need to know where to adjust numbers or filenames to make it work with your data.\n",
