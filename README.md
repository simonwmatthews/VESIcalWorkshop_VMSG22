# The VESIcal Workshop at VMSG 2022
This is a repository for the workshop run  by Simon Matthews and Penny Wieser at the virtual VMSG meeting in January 2022.

We will upload the videos of the talks and the guides to the exercises very soon, and we will link to them here. Until then, you can run the exercises yourself (and use VESIcal) in the cloud using myBinder by clicking the button below. The slides are also in the repository (download above).

For more information about VESIcal, look at our [website](vesical.readthedocs.io), or read VESIcal [Part I](https://doi.org/10.1029/2020EA001584) and [Part II](https://doi.org/10.31223/X5K03T). 

To run the exercises in your web browser, launch binder here:

Note, there are some deprecation warnings generated when some of the cells are run, you can ignore these!
